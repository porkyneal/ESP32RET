ESP32RET
=======

Reverse Engineering Tool running on ESP32 based hardware. Supports both EVTV ESP32 and Macchina A0


#### Requirements:

You will need the following to be able to compile the run this project:

- [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) Tested on 1.8.13
- [Arduino-ESP32](https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32) - Allows for programming the ESP32 with the Arduino IDE
- [esp32_can](https://github.com/collin80/esp32_can) - A unified CAN library that supports the built-in CAN plus MCP2515 and MCP2517FD
- [can_common](https://github.com/collin80/can_common) - Common structures and functionality for CAN libraries

PLEASE NOTE: The Macchina A0 uses a WRover ESP32 module which includes PSRAM. But, do NOT use the WRover
board in the Arduino IDE nor try to enable PSRAM. Doing so causes a fatal crash bug.

The EVTV board has no PSRAM anyway.

This program is larger than the default partitioning scheme. You will need to use
a larger scheme. The recommended way to do this: Tools -> Partition Scheme -> Minimal SPIFFS

All libraries belong in %USERPROFILE%\Documents\Arduino\hardware\esp32\libraries (Windows) or ~/Arduino/hardware/esp32/libraries (Linux/Mac).

The canbus is supposed to be terminated on both ends of the bus. This should not be a problem as this firmware will be used to reverse engineer existing buses. However, do note that CAN buses should have a resistance from CAN_H to CAN_L of 60 ohms. This is affected by placing a 120 ohm resistor on both sides of the bus. If the bus resistance is not fairly close to 60 ohms then you may run into trouble.  

#### The firmware is a work in progress. What works:
- CAN0 / CAN1 reading and writing
- Preferences are saved and loaded
- Text console is active (configuration and CAN capture display)
- Can connect as a GVRET device with SavvyCAN
- LAWICEL support (somewhat tested. Still experimental)
- Bluetooth works to create an ELM327 compatible interface (tested with Torque app)

#### What does not work:
- Digital and Analog I/O
